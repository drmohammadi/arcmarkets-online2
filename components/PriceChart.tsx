/**
 * Price line: one small dot per trade, joined oldest-to-newest by a continuous
 * line. No candlesticks, no indicators, no drawing tools, no time-range tabs.
 *
 * The x-axis is trade SEQUENCE, not time, which is what lets the whole thing
 * avoid fetching a timestamp for every block (the old chart's single largest
 * source of RPC traffic). The last point is always the live contract price, so
 * the right-hand edge is correct even when no trade logs could be loaded at all.
 *
 * Still hand-rolled SVG: a polyline and some circles do not justify a charting
 * library in the bundle.
 *
 * ── TWO RENDERING BUGS THIS FIXES ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Reported as "the chart only shows a single large blue dot". Both causes were
 * here, on top of the data problem fixed in `hooks/useTradeHistory.ts`:
 *
 *  1. **Only ONE point was ever drawn.** A circle was emitted for the last point
 *     alone, so the intermediate trades existed in the path but had no markers.
 *
 *  2. **`preserveAspectRatio="none"` on a square viewBox stretched it.** The
 *     viewBox was 100x100 rendered into a box roughly 900x200, so x scaled ~9x
 *     and y ~2x. `vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke"` compensates for the STROKE
 *     but does nothing for geometry, so `r={3}` painted as a ~54x12px ellipse —
 *     a single large blue blob. With no trades loaded, that lone stretched
 *     marker sitting at the centre was the entire chart.
 *
 * The fix for (2) is to stop using a synthetic coordinate system: the viewBox is
 * now the element's ACTUAL pixel size, so the scale is exactly 1 and a circle is
 * a circle. That is also why the radii below can be stated in real pixels and
 * trusted.

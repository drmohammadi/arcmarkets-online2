/**
 * Wallet + query providers.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `getDefaultConfig`
 * ----------------------------------
 * Every wallet except Coinbase reaches this app through the WalletConnect relay,
 * and the relay requires a real project id. This file used to fall back to
 * `projectId: 'demo'`, which is not a valid id — the relay handshake failed
 * silently, so on mobile MetaMask/Trust/Rainbow appeared in the picker and did
 * nothing at all when tapped. Coinbase Wallet still worked because its connector
 * uses the Coinbase SDK and never touches the relay, which is exactly why it was
 * the only one that worked.
 *
 * `getDefaultConfig` always installs the relay-backed wallets, so it cannot
 * express "only offer wallets that can actually connect". Hence the explicit
 * connector list below: the picker is built from what is actually functional in
 * the current configuration, so a user is never offered a dead button.
 *
 * To enable the full list, set NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID to a real id
 * from https://cloud.reown.com (free). See frontend/.env.example.

 * sees its own request.
 *
 * NOT enabling `batch: true` (JSON-RPC batching) deliberately. It would be the
 * single biggest further win — it collapses N `eth_call`s into one HTTP request
 * — but if the endpoint rejects batched payloads then EVERY read fails rather
 * than degrading, and Arc's public RPC could not be reached from the dev
 * environment to confirm support. Verify against the live endpoint first, then

 * `lib/rpcQueue.ts` already owns 429 backoff, and doing it in two places
 * compounds. Genuine one-off failures still get a single retry.
 *
